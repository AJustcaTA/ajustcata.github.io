This is a simple diary of our Terraria server. Screenshots are stored in `/posts/terraria-server-daily-record/`.

## Day 0.5 - First Setup

We started small and practical. I helped set up a basic wooden base with:
- NPC rooms on the top floor
- a crafting corner in the middle
- a small storage basement

It was already enough to feel like "home".

## Day 1 - Cave Fishing With Friends

Today felt peaceful. We had a Lantern Night, and the sky above our base was full of floating lanterns.

After that, we went fishing in a cave. Three of us stood by an underground lake, placed some torches, and just fished together for a while.

## Day 2 - Boss Progress + New Gear

We gave the Eater of Worlds a try, and we beat it. The base started to look more serious, with trophies/relics and better organization.

New weapons (thanks to Yusagi):
- Blade of Grass
- Light's Bane
- Nightmare Pickaxe

## Day 3 - Base Upgrade + Underworld Prep + Skeletron Night

The base got bigger again. More rooms, more storage, and the whole place started to feel like a real HQ.

![Base upgrade](/posts/terraria-server-daily-record/day3-base-upgrade.png)

Yusagi was basically living in the storage room (and keeping things tidy).

### Where did the Hellstone Bars go?

When I joined, the top left should have had a lot of Hellstone Bars, but they were gone after a few hours.

![Inventory overview with missing Hellstone Bars](/posts/terraria-server-daily-record/day3-missing-hellstone.png)

Then I realized what happened: someone used them to craft armor.

### Underworld run: Hellstone + Lava

Before we went down, I prepared my inventory:
- Obsidian Skin Potion (lava immunity)
- Ironskin + Swiftness (for safety and movement)

![Underworld preparation items](/posts/terraria-server-daily-record/day3-underworld-prep.png)

Mining Hellstone always feels dangerous because it releases lava, but it was worth it.

![Mining Hellstone in the Underworld](/posts/terraria-server-daily-record/day3-underworld-mining.png)

:::important
Hellstone mining is risky. Even with potions, always watch your HP and your escape path.
:::

:::tip[How to get Obsidian]
You can make Obsidian by letting water touch lava. The blocks that form at the contact point are Obsidian.

### Time for Skeletron

We built a platform arena with campfires and started the fight at night. It was fast, chaotic, and honestly really fun.

### ??? moment

This screenshot feels like a quick "squad photo" during the adventure.

## Day 4 - Server Trouble + New Rooms

:::warning[Shockbyte incident]
When I woke up, there was a Shockbyte incident and the server startup parameters were missing.

The server kept starting in interactive mode and got stuck on the world selection prompt.

Log snippet:
```text

Server down for about 3 hours.

After that, we found (or built) a "secret tunnel" that looks like a hellevator going deeper and deeper.

![Secret tunnel / hellevator](/posts/terraria-server-daily-record/day4-secret-tunnel.png)

Then the base expanded for player rooms. The layout is clean: stacked rooms, beds, strong lighting, and a vertical shaft for quick movement.

![Player rooms layout (right)](/posts/terraria-server-daily-record/day4-player-rooms-2.png)

And yes... we expanded even more to the right side.

We also went back to fishing because I wanted the Anklet of the Wind.

:::tip[Anklet of the Wind -> Lightning Boots]
The Anklet of the Wind can be found in Jungle Crates (fishing in the Jungle) or Ivy Chests.
Later, it can be used for Lightning Boots (with Spectre Boots + Aglet + Anklet).

## Day 5 - Cozy Room + Movement Upgrade

Yusagi's room is honestly cozy. It has warm lighting, a small water feature, and a nice underground vibe.

![Yusagi's cozy room](/posts/terraria-server-daily-record/day5-yusagi-room.png)

Big thanks to Yusagi for helping me with movement upgrades. I finally got Lightning Boots (Wild Lightning Boots in my inventory).

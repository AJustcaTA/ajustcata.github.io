:::note
Mod we played: [Minecraft Found Footage](https://modrinth.com/mod/minecraft-found-footage)
:::

We hosted a small server (Shockbyte) and tried a Backrooms-style horror mod together. The best part is not the monsters (yet) but the *video* feeling: shaky camera, heavy atmosphere, and a lot of "did you hear that?" moments.

:::important
The mod's idea is simple: it aims to bring the feeling and aesthetic of "found footage" videos to Minecraft.
:::

## A quick Backrooms refresher

The Backrooms started as an internet horror idea in 2019: an endless maze of empty rooms that feel familiar, but wrong. A lot of modern Backrooms stories use a "found footage" style, like a shaky home video, to make everything feel more real.

- The original post describes wet carpet, old wallpaper, and buzzing fluorescent lights.
- People "enter" by noclipping through solid objects.
- The setting is usually split into levels (lobby, basements, pools, and more).

:::tip[How we entered]
We started in the Overworld. After we kept suffocating for long enough (on purpose), the game finally "noclipped" us into the Backrooms.

## Levels we reached

- Level 0: the classic yellow maze
- Level 1: more industrial, more "I should not be here"
- Level 2: we rushed it (and forgot to screenshot)
- The Poolrooms: calm-looking, but still unsettling
- Infinite Grass Field: beautiful and wrong at the same time

## Level 0

The first minutes were pure confusion. We kept walking in circles, and every hallway looked the same. That is exactly why it works.

## Level 1

Level 1 felt more "livable" than Level 0, but it also felt like something could appear behind any corner. We moved slower, talked less, and listened more.

## The Poolrooms

This was the most photogenic part. Blue tiles, soft light, long empty pools. It looks peaceful, but the silence is loud.

## Infinite Grass Field

After all the tight corridors, the grass field felt like relief. Then it started to feel like a trap: too open, too quiet, and nowhere to hide.
